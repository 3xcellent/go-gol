# gol_go
## What?
This repo is my attempt at learning [Go](https://golang.org/). 

## Why?
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) has not entered into my career thus far, so what better time than while also learning a new language.

Kyle Banks'
[OpenGL & Go Tutorial](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/tutorial-opengl-with-golang-part-1-hello-opengl) seems like place to start.

## 

### Things I expect to learn:
* How to install and configure golang on both Windows and Mac OS X systems
* How to write, compile and run Go projects
* Using a new IDE; in this case likely vscode
* How to use OpenGL

## Running
Currently this is only working on Mac OS X and Linux.  I have only tried running it once on Windows 10, it didn't work, and I haven't looked into since.

### Setup
* install [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/)
* install dependencies:
	* ```go get github.com/go-gl/gl/v4.1-core/gl```
	* ```go get github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.2/glfw```
* what else?
