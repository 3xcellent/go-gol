# gol_go
Created ~May 2019, this repo was my first attempt at writing in [Go](https://golang.org/).  I had also never done anything with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) before, and mainly focused on my understanding of golang and seeing pretty boxes in a window on the screen, as opposed to a terminal with curses.
