# gol_go
## What?
This repo is my first attempt at writing in [Go](https://golang.org/).  I have also never done anything with [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), but I am mainly focusing on my understanding of golang.

I started by following Kyle Banks'
[OpenGL & Go Tutorial](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/tutorial-opengl-with-golang-part-1-hello-opengl), but it has many errors, and quickly relied on Google (Stack Overflow :/).
