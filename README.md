# gol_go
## Learn Go
This repo is my attempt at learning [Go](https://golang.org/). 

## Learn OpenGL?
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) has not entered into my career thus far, so what better time than while also learning a new language.

Kyle Banks'
[OpenGL & Go Tutorial](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/tutorial-opengl-with-golang-part-1-hello-opengl) seems like place to start.

## Things I expect to learn:
* How to install and configure golang on both Windows and Mac OS X systems
* How to write, compile and run Go projects
* Using a new IDE; in this case likely vscode
* How to use OpenGL
